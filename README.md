# learning-regression-R

My exploration with linear regression in R to predict card spending by bank customers.

Used a 5000 record database to predict card spending by bank customers. 
Available features = 132
Objective was to find which features affect the spending and to what extent. 

Pipeline showed in html file or R markdown file.
